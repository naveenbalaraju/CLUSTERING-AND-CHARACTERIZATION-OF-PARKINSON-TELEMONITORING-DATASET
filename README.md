# Clustering-and-characterization-of-Parkinson-s-Telemonitoring-dataset
1. To implement Clustering on Parkinson’s Telemonitoring dataset and characterize “Jitter” Related variable for a new patient with a High UPDRS score.

2. Consider the Parkinsons Telemonitoring Dataset on the UCI Machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons+Telemonitoring). This data set was developed with 10 medical centers. Together with a corporation, they developed a telemonitoring device to record speech signals of patients for the prediction
 of clinical Parkinson’s disease symptom scores on a UPDRS scale.

3. The task is to Cluster this data expalin How well do the clusters capture “motor_UPDRS” and “total_UPDRS”.

4.  Fit a Bayesian Network using this data and  characterize “Jitter” related variables for a new patient
that has a relatively high UPDRS score (two standard deviations above the mean).
